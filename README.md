# RL Bandit Workbook
## Overview
This library serves as a simple way to use pre-existing bandit algorithms for data science inside a python notebook.
There are two primary files with the RLNotes folder:
    1. Bandits.py – contains Bandit and environment classes as well as general use functions
    2. RLNotebook.ipynb – contains python notebook with detailed example of how the implementation works inside a pynb

## Installation
First, clone this repository. It is recommended you create a venv before installing the required python libraries.
For instructions on setting up your virtual environment, see https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python

Once you have your venv activated, install the required libraries by running the following command:
```bash
pip/pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

To test if it is properly set-up, try running the first cell in the .ipynb file.
